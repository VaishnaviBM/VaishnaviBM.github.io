                <h1>Vaishnavi B Mohan</h1>

            <p>Hi, I am Vaishnavi, a PhD student in Vision Neuroscience and Perception at the University of Washington, Seattle advised by <a href="https://psych.uw.edu/people/3572visi" target="_blank">Prof. Geoffrey Boynton </a> and <a href="https://psych.uw.edu/people/2400" target="_blank">Prof. Ione Fine.</a> I hold a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from  <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/ " target="_blank">National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India. </a>, and a Masters in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/academics/ms/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> where I specialized in signal processing and machine learning. Prior to my PhD, I spent about four years at Intel Corporation as a Software Development Engineer where I developed a strong background in computational methods and programming with applications to computer vision and large vision models.  </p>
            
            <p> Working with deep learning models which guzzle compute (and thereby, power) during inference, and data during training, I was always fascinated by human vision and how the brain learns to efficiently process such a rich array of information coming in through our eyes. Therefore, I began my PhD in Vision+Cognition Group at UW. My research revolves around visual perception in the context of sight recovery technologies for late-onset of blindness. Late-onset of blindness is usually caused due to genetic mutations and can be devastating for people to lose their sight. Hence, there are multiple emerging technologies which are trying to make the visual system respond to light again in such individuals. However, the resulting perception can be highly distorted and different from neurotypical vision. My research is all about understanding how this neural response translates to perception: a simulation framework to predict the visual perceptual experience of these technologies to inform systematic improvement in design methodologies. </p>
            
            <p> Broadly, I develop perception models using psychophysics experiments, computational methods and information-theoretical approaches. I also develop theoretical mathematical models to simulate the neural responses for optogenetics-mediated vision. </p>
